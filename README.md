# djanjo_taiwind_alpine_start

## Since Django takes a lot of time to start. I created this repo to give a head start 

## This template has been additionally configured to use tailwind css and alpine js
1.download the tailwind standalone (it doesn't matter the platform) and put in directly in the Static directory 
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.2.0
2. run the stand alone file and there it is it works
